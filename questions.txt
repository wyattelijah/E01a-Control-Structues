Open main1.py. Before running it, what do you expect this program to do?
I expect this to check what version of Python we are using.

Now right click on the window and select “Run Python File in Terminal”. Click in the bottom panel, and answer the question. Describe what happened. 
The program printed out PS followed by the url for the folder we made

What do you think the program did with what you typed?
I think that the program took my answer and stored it in the repository folder


Open main2.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main1.py. 
In main2 there is a variable color and then color is printed instead of just printing the input like in main1
What do you think the color = input() will do? 
I think color = input() will set color to the specified input
Run the program in the terminal and answer the question. Did the program do what you expected?
No, the programmed added a step I did not expect and printed the color that I typed in


Open main3.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main2.py. 
Main3 adds an if else after the color declaration
What is happening on lines 11–14? 
The if is checking to see if you enter in "Red" and if not it will print "Try again"
Why are lines 12 and 14 indented? 
They are indented because they are within the if and the else
Run the program and answer the question. What happens if you don’t capitalize Red? 

What does this tell you about "color"?



Open main4.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main2.py. 

What problem is this trying to solve? 

Run the program and answer the question. What happens if you use some other capitalization scheme (i.e., “RED” or “reD“)?



Open main5.py. What do you expect line 11 to do? 

What problem is it trying to solve? 

Run the program and answer the question. What happens if you add spaces before or after the word (i.e., “  RED  “ or “ red”)?



Open main6.py. How is line 11 different than main5.py? 

What would you guess .strip() is doing? 

Run the program and answer the question. Is there another way of writing “red” that will break this logic?



Open main7.py. Before running this program, how do you expect this to be different than main6.py? 

What is the purpose of line 11? 

Run the program and answer the question.



Open main8.py. What is the purpose of line 11? 

Why are lines 12–19 indented? 

Run the program. What would happen if line 12 were moved before line 11 (and no longer indented)? 

Make that change and run the program again. To end any Python program, you can type ctrl-c.



Open main9.py. What is happening on line 12? 

What is the purpose of “count”? 

What is happening on line 22? 

Run the program.
